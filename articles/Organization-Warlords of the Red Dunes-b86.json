    "content": "The Warlords of the Red Dunes are desert tribes of fanatical warrior priests who believe their people have been shaped into something greater than human by the crucible that is their hot and barren environment. They believe that the desert has a will of its own and see themselves as the personification of that will. Their holy duty is to force all of humanity to undergo the test of the desert, to become strong and tough, shaking off the poisonous weakness that more bountiful lands inject into both spirit and flesh of its inhabitants. Those too weak to pass the test will die trying and humanity will ascend to finally fulfil its true potential.\r\n\r\n[h2]Symbols and Visuals[/h2]\r\n\r\nMany members of the Warlords of the Red Dunes adorn their clothes, which are mostly held in simple browns or greys, with small scarves or veils of red. They usually carry small packs with all essential needs and are well armed, ready to either travel or fight at a moment’s notice. The weapons they prefer include short stabbing spears, daggers of all forms, some nearly the length of a short sword, and the shakh, crescent shaped blades that can be used in melee or even thrown, nearly like a boomerang.\r\n\r\n[h2]Motivations and Goals[/h2]\r\n\r\nThe Warlords of the Red Dunes believe that only what they call “The Scorching Path” holds the key to humanity’s salvation. They look upon the so called “achievements” of neighbouring civilisations with contempt, due to their belief that superior technology and the more hospitable lands such people live in do is to make them weak, both as societies and individually. They believe that one cannot rely on outside tools and helpful environmental forces, for all such things can be taken away. Humanity must rely only upon the strength of its own flesh, the power of its own will, to reach its greatest potential. The desert, so say the priests, is a crucible, designed by the gods to make humanity strong, burning away all softness and weakness. But they also believe that the desert is alive with a will of its own, a mighty spirit that seeks to stretch its influence until most of the world has succumbed to its power. The people of the Rd Dunes sees themselves as agents of the desert and prophets of its path, seeking to spread both across the world.\r\n\r\n[h2]Origins and History[/h2]\r\n\r\nWhile the Yrthosi migrated to the north of the region, the Highlanders settled within the rocky plains of the Scorching Highlands splintering into several tribes who followed many different leaders and shamans, who claimed they spoke with spirits of wind and rock, sun and moon. In 1740 CE, an orc known as Grovis came to the highlanders, a man who was not of the tribes but instead a member of a merchant caravan that was caught in a sandstorm and all but wiped out. He cast off his past, denounced his former name and proclaimed himself to the highlanders that he had been chosen by the one true spirit of the sands. From this day onward the influence of Grovis has spread amongst the tribes, and many of the shamans and soothsayers had been cast out and all tribal chieftains have accepted Grovis as their leader, creating the Warlords of the Red Dunes.\r\n\r\n[h2]Methods and Resources[/h2]\r\n\r\nWhile Grovis is known as the Voice of the Sands, his followers are more suited to action than too discussion. They have some skilled philosophers within their ranks, people capable of explaining the importance of “The Scorching Path”, but most of their members are tough warriors, skilled in surviving both the harshness of the desert and the bloody madness of combat. They are dangerous raiders, preferring to strike quickly and efficiently, retreating with plunder and, more importantly, captives, before resistance can be organised. Such captives can be members of the highlands tribes who are less eager to serve the Voice of the Sands, caravan travellers from the Yrthosi cities in Al-Khet, or even people who live in settlements in the Riverlands.\r\n\r\nAll such captives become recruits, forced to walk “The Scorching Path”. Many die along the way, but a chosen few survive and emerge stronger than they ever were, ready to be embraced as a member of the Red Dunes Tribes. While this faction doesn’t have much material wealth except for their weapons, they do have a strong connection to their land, making many of them capable of magical feats.\r\n\r\n[h2]Structure and Members[/h2]\r\n\r\nAs a faction with strong tribal roots, Red Dunes has a strict hierarchy, with each individual member knowing exactly where they stand. As the very top is, obviously, Grovis the Voice of the Sands, whose every command is obeyed without question. Below him are the Windspeakers, high priests of the desert, who can communicate with powerful spirits and are capable of potent magical feats. They are mostly senior figures who have followed Grovis for decades, although there also exist a few very young Windspeakers, children who, it is said, were shaped by the desert itself as living conduits of its power.\r\n\r\nBelow the Windspeakers are the Warlords, who lead many of the individual tribes and rely on the advice of the Windspeakers. Below the Warlords are the Redspears, elite warriors and hunters, veterans who have proven their skill and dedication to the cause many times. Each Redspear usually commands a raiding party of warriors known as the Devoted. The Devoted are the rank and file of the tribes, who bear the blunt of the fighting, organised in groups of one to three dozen At the very bottom finally as the Dusters, those who are still being shaped by The Scorching Path. This group includes both the children of the tribes, and those children or adults who were captured and enslaved on the raids. Once Dusters have proven themselves, they become Devoted and each of them, if they have the tenacity and will for it, could rise even higher.",
