    "content": "Born to Cormac and Anna Heffernan, Sean lived a very simple life, though this peace would not last forever. Only two years after Sean was born, he lost his mother due to complications during the birth of his sister, Elizabeth. Elizabeth was also hit with a bout of misfortune, being born with a mysterious ailment that left her incredibly weak when trying to exert energy. The source of this ailment was a mystery, though luckily basic medicinal herbs and potions were able to assuage the ill effects for some time. This was all very devastating for Cormac, and he was left alone to provide for Sean and Liz.\r\n\r\nDue to their situation, Sean grew up with Liz in the slums of Eldoria. Cormac was constantly working in the factories within the city's walls and freelancing with multiple merchants, trying to earn enough money to make ends meet. The amount of time he spent working led to poor health, and Cormac passed at around the time of Sean's 12th birthday.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Sean had adopted Cormac's hard work ethic and was able to start working in the same factories that Cormac frequented to keep food on the table. Looking after Liz had become his top priority and his was willing to do anything and everything required of him to get ahead in the business.\r\n\r\nIt was here, working within the world of merchants, that Sean made his one and only friend, Ryker Sloane. Sean didn't have a lot of time for relationships outside of work and Liz, so he truly cherished this friendship. The three grew up together, nigh inseparable. However, as they grew older, Ryker started getting involved in some shady activities. In pursuit of an escape from poverty, Ryker grew further and further apart from the Heffernans and got deeper and deeper into his clandestine affairs. By the age of 24, Sean no longer had any contact with Ryker. He just seemed to disappear one day.\r\n\r\nOver time, Sean was able to prove himself more and more, and rose through the corporate ranks, often filling any role required of him. At only 28 years old, he now has experience as a labourer, an accountant, a manager, an administrator and a salesman. He was at home in an office space as much as he was out in the field doing the grunt work. Due to these constant promotions, Sean was able to afford better and better medicine for Liz. The difference in her demeanour compared to when they were children were astounding. She was now able to sing and dance for small stints of time and, when she was feeling up to it, was even able to take small excursions outside the house. It was on one of these excursions that Sean's life took a turn for the worst.\r\n\r\nWhile exploring the streets just outside the market district, Liz was hit by a sudden dizzy spell as they took a chance and adventured a little further out than she was used to. Sean sat her down so she could recover her energy and rushed off to fetch her some water. Shortly after this, a merchant's convoy (headed by Viktor Darkstone himself) tore through the streets. Viktor seemed to be in quite a rush and egged the steeds leading the caravan on faster. Sean turned the corner just in time to see Liz hurriedly attempting to stand and get out of the way. He turned the corner just in time to hear Viktor's booming voice echoing \"MOVE IT!\" from his position in the driverâ€™s seat. He turned the corner just in time to smell the blood as every carriage in the convoy effortlessly barrelled over Liz's body. With the only other person in this world that he loved being taken from him in a matter of second, Sean was overcome by his emotions. Immobilized by the deep depression left within him, he stayed in the street holding Liz's corpse for an entire day and night. Nobody came to help. Nobody, except for the Spirit of Vengeance. Maltharion, the Spirit of Vengeance heard Sean's cries and reached out to him, offering opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"Work for me, and in return I can give you the power to avenge this grievous misdeed.\" Sean knew that Viktor had so many connections and assets that he was practically untouchable within the city of Eldoria. He also knew the downsides of accepting a deal with the devil, but at this point he did not care what the repercussions would be. What he did NOT know, however, is that the deals are a little more sophisticated than he thought. Instead of simply signing his soul away, the Spirit told Sean that there are others vying for his power, and that he will have to earn it. Kind of like a spooky internship program.\r\n\r\nSean accepted the pact and set out to prove himself by becoming a wannabe vigilante in his district. He would find undesirables terrorizing innocents who were deemed 'sinners' by the Spirit, and he would kill them - to differing levels of success. He was not yet very good at this kind of thing as clerical work does not translate well to straight-up murder. Eventually his targets started to put up more and more of a fight and he began to ruffle the feathers of a few people who have a much higher standing in the city than random druggies and misfits.\r\n\r\nThis led to a hit being placed on Sean's head, and the one sent to collect was none other than Ryker himself. Ryker has worked himself up throughout the ranks within The Onyx Covenant to become a highly skilled assassin. Sean fought back but was wildly outmatched by Ryker. Ryker declared that this was just a job to him, and he did not want their shared history to go to waste - especially because he did not see Sean as too much of a threat. He let him escape under the condition that he never return to Eldoria again, or he will finish the job.\r\n\r\nSean left the scene and felt nothing but an intense sense of motivation. He was completely outclassed by Ryker - and if his childhood friend was able to master the art of conflict, then there was no reason he couldn't either. He needed to get a lot more experience in this role if he was to take Viktor out. On his way out of town, he found a posting on the city's job board seeking mercenary aid for a routine supply run to Ravenwood. He approached the Order of the Emerald Blade, demanding an interview. Despite that not being their recruitment process, the recruiters humoured him, and he managed to talk his way onto the escort despite his lack of marital training. Uncomfortable with sending a completely green civilian into a potentially dangerous situation, a few of the paladins took the time to show him some basic swordplay and techniques before heading out to increase his chance of survival.",
