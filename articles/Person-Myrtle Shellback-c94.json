    "content": "Myrtle Shellback was born within a barn in an abandoned farm. The same barn is where her mother apparently committed suicide when she was around four years old. Her father went missing shortly after, leaving Myrtle and her seven siblings alone and vulnerable. They were discovered by a traveling monk named Brother Francis, who took them to a nearby monastery to be cared for and raised.\r\n\r\nThere, Myrtle was taken under the wing of a male human monk named Brother Thomas, who became her mentor and guide in the ways of the monk. She grew up with her siblings in the modest surroundings of the monastery, but despite the simple lifestyle, her childhood was a generally happy one. Myrtle had several friends and spent much of her time in the gardens or in quiet contemplation, seeking to gain a deeper understanding of existence and her place in the world.\r\n\r\nHowever, as she grew older, Myrtle began to feel restless and yearned for more than the routine and discipline of the monastery. She sought instruction from Brother Thomas in the ways of alchemy, fascinated by the idea of transmuting one substance into another and unlocking the secrets of the universe.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time that Myrtle committed a crime that would change the course of her life. In a moment of desperation, she kidnapped a wealthy merchant who she believed had wronged her and her siblings. Although her intentions were initially to use the ransom money to help her family, she was caught and imprisoned before she could carry out her plan.\r\n\r\nWhile in prison, Myrtle reflected on her actions and the lessons she had learned from Brother Thomas. She realized that her pursuit of knowledge and power had clouded her judgment and led her astray from the path of compassion and kindness that she had been taught. With renewed determination, Myrtle vowed to use her alchemical skills for good and to make amends for her past mistakes.\r\n\r\nUpon her release, Myrtle left the monastery and began a journey of self-discovery, using her alchemical knowledge to aid those in need and to explore the mysteries of the universe. She carries with her the teachings of Brother Thomas and the values instilled in her by her upbringing, seeking to live a life of balance and harmony in a world full of chaos and conflict.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session I - The Witchlight Carnival! Myrtle Shellback is an elderly Tortle monk who lost three inches of height and can no longer tie or untie non-magical rope. Upon entering the Witchlight Carnival, she reluctantly handed over her ticket to a child and later received a new ticket with the pact that she cannot tell a lie knowingly. Myrtle failed to catch a sycamore seed, but Nishara gave her one out of pity. Myrtle tried and failed three times to catch a faerie dragon, then received her cane back from Nishara, who had decorated it with flowers. She succeeded in pinning a goblin in the wrestling event and won a Cuddly Toy Spider. Myrtle failed to outstare a cyclops and claimed it was due to not having her afternoon nap. During a rat attack, Myrtle killed two rats with her quarterstaff and claws. She later selected the blue snail Nimblefoot for the snail race but did not win. Myrtle also participated in the gnome poetry contest and the ring toss game but did not win. After spotting a mysterious girl named Sowpig, Myrtle attempted to find her, but the girl disappeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session II - The Crowning of the Monarch Myrtle was taken aback by the sight of the mysterious girl with a pig mask, but she quickly refocused when the group welcomed Tarin Ganu-Maga, a towering Goliath Barbarian. Myrtle suggested they explore the Mystery Mine. During the ride, Myrtle faced her worst fears but emerged somewhat shaken. She later joined the group in the Bubble-Pop Teapot, where they floated in bubbles and reconvened at the Hall of Illusions. Myrtle gleefully adopted the pixie name Cobweb during their visit to Pixie Kingdom, where she played hide and seek but was caught after casting a minor illusion. She was successful in the Whack-a-Mole game, where she destroyed a Tin Soldier during a mimic encounter. At the Lost Property area, she chased after a boy named Viro and helped return him to Dirlagraun, a displacer beast. Myrtle later had her cane broken by Thaco, the Clown, after attempting to take something without permission in the staff area. She obtained Mister Witch’s watch using Talia’s iron scissors and joined the party in the Feasting Orchard, where they met their benefactor, Ellywick Tumblestrum. Myrtle tried the gondola ride but was tipped overboard by Feathereen, the swan. She also dived into the water to chase after Palasha, the mermaid, and convinced her to return to her performance. Myrtle encountered a mirror in the Hall of Illusions but was unable to follow Rubin Sugarwood through it. She was the last to step through the mirror to Hither after being advised by Mister Witch and Mister Light.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session III - The Slanty Tower Myrtle arrives at the other end of the mirror after the party has already engaged in a battle with Lornlings. Once she joins the group, Talia removes a deflated balloon from Myrtle's wrist that she couldn't remove herself. Myrtle quickly dispatches two Harengon bandits during a robbery attempt, forcing the others to flee. In a later encounter with two Giant Constrictor Snakes, Myrtle attacks ferociously, but she is reduced to 1 hit point twice during the fight. Despite this, she manages to break free from a grapple and delivers significant damage to one of the snakes. She continues to fight bravely but is ultimately forced to rely on the rest of the party to heal her. After the battle, Myrtle attempts to cut some brambles to make a fire but fails. When confronted by Lorna, the Lornling, Myrtle tries to talk her down but resorts to using her alchemist tools to create a smoke screen when diplomacy fails. After Lorna escapes, Myrtle jumps out of a window in pursuit, landing dramatically only to see Lorna fleeing on a snake. Despite Talavar's call to find Jingle Jangle, Myrtle is unable to track Lorna. She later injures herself while trying to extract a tooth from a serpent and falls unconscious, requiring healing from Nishara.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session IV - The Missing Firbolg Myrtle takes the initiative as the party continues their journey. After defeating the Mud Mephits, they encounter Gahr Reegh, a naked human, and Myrtle contributes clothing to him. At Telemy Hill, Myrtle searches for fruit but finds nothing. She later gifts Talia her darts and bravely runs across the stepping stones in a foggy marsh, although she ultimately falls, offending the Galeb Duhr and leading to a conflict with Merrows, during which she is knocked unconscious. Talia heals her, allowing her to rejoin the fight. Myrtle also assists in putting out fires in the balloon factory, using salt and water against animated coals. At the Soggy Court, Myrtle dramatically introduces Nishara to King Gullop XIX and helps the party secure a task from the king. Myrtle stabilizes Gahr after he falls unconscious and takes a leadership role in the negotiations with King Gullop XIX.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session V - The Loss of a Friend Myrtle becomes involved in the battle between Tarin and Morgot at the proving ground. Though unable to save Morgot, Myrtle later attempts to open the door to free Wirth, but it’s Tarin who ultimately breaks it down. Myrtle performs stunning acrobatics, delivering a triple-punch to a Bullywug’s throat, but is knocked unconscious in the process. After recovering, Myrtle visits Trinket and Bauble’s shop, where she purchases a monocle at the cost of her eye color. Despite the party's efforts to return a book to Bavlorna, Myrtle finds herself increasingly frustrated, especially after the battle with the tree, where she breaks a finger during a critical fail. However, she delivers the final blow to the tree, turning it to stone. The following day, Myrtle is devastated to find Nishara’s lifeless body, and the party holds a solemn burial for Nishara beneath the tree, honoring her memory.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VI - The Medusa's Gaze Mrytle attempts to negotiate with Illig, the leader of the Bullywug Resistance, and taks charge in several challenging situations. However, her luck runs out during the battle with the Medusa, where she is grievously injured and ultimately loses her life. Myrtle's death leaves a profound impact on the party, who mourn her deeply and honor her memory with a heartfelt burial beneath a tree.",
