    "content": "During the events of Session VI - The Medusa's Gaze Lilygrove joins the party after the Medusa battle and quickly becomes an integral part of the group. She proves her worth by skillfully negotiating with Bavlorna Blightstraw, securing the witch's help in unpetrifying Talia and Tarin, though some residual effects of the petrification remain. Lilygrove uses her magical abilities to enhance Kiara's features during the negotiations, showing her resourcefulness and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VII - The Electric Shock Lilygrove is revealed to have her own hidden agenda, adding a layer of complexity to the group’s dynamic. After casting a sleep spell that accidentally puts Gahr to sleep during the wasp encounter, she quickly redeems herself by helping to defeat the swarm. However, her true intentions come to light when she tries to manipulate the party into stealing Sir Talavar. Her use of fey presence to charm Gahr nearly succeeds, but Sir Talavar exposes her deception. Under pressure, Lilygrove admits that she is bound by honor to return Sir Talavar to King Gullop XIX, leading to a tense standoff. Despite this, she manages to negotiate a fragile alliance with Kiara, agreeing to work together against Bavlorna and the Hourglass Coven.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VIII - The Hag of Downfall Lilygrove examines the corridor’s artwork with Tarin, and after Charm and Bavlorna exit, she turns invisible and begins toppling paintings, only to have Talia diligently restore them. Lilygrove’s encounter with a painting that wouldn’t budge results in her breaking a finger, only to discover that it’s actually a mirror. She whimsically alters her reflection in the mirror, a secret only Wirth is privy to. Later, Lilygrove’s attempt to use a needle to open a small door backfires, injuring Wirth and leading to the realization that the entire group has shrunk. After they navigate the door and return to their original sizes, Lilygrove consoles Bavlorna when she returns in distress, though this results in Bavlorna unexpectedly ingesting her. Despite the odd mishap, Lilygrove is eventually returned by Bavlorna, along with an iron key. Lilygrove helps to release birds in the aviary, though her sleep spell inadvertently puts Gahr to sleep. She also discovers a kitchen with Tarin, where they assist Bloody Toes, a redcap, who reveals a secret about Bavlorna’s peculiar weakness.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session IX - The Blood Pact Lilygrove gives Tarin a parchment that restores her ability to write legibly after Tarin confides her lost thing to the bronze frog statue. While investigating Bavlorna's room, Lilygrove finds a porcelain jar with a painted chicken-leg motif, inside of which she discovers two broken pieces of a wishbone. After mending the wishbone, she hears Bavlorna’s voice revealing a crucial secret about Skabatha's memory. Later, Lilygrove accidentally causes a scene in Nib’s Cave by casting a charm spell that fails to affect everyone, resulting in Talia hurling a dagger at her. Lilygrove shapeshifts into Miara during a tense moment to test Kiara’s story about her twin. This leads to her promising the group not to cast spells on them or change her form unless it benefits the group. She also shares crucial information about defeating Bavlorna and helps the party unite against the Hourglass Coven through a blood pact.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session X - The Unicorn of Wayward Pool Lilygrove leads the party through the forest, where they encounter various creatures and challenges. Lilygrove interacts with the campestris, gaining truesight, and later helps release a campestri from a jar Kiara took. She becomes separated during a night watch and is captured by a monster, leading the party to Little Oak, where she meets Will and the Getaway Gang. Lilygrove and Will quickly become rivals, with frequent quips exchanged between them. She provides the party with minor illusion horns for their journey to Wayward Pool, where she sees Myrtle's ghost again, leading to a humorous and chaotic moment when Tarin is thrown by the lake's magic. Lilygrove later drinks a polymorph potion, turning into a giant frog, and helps the party cross the lake to meet Lamorna the Unicorn. She plays a significant role in the battle against Zarak, eventually grappling the assassin in her frog form, allowing the party to defeat him.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XI - The Knight and the Paladin Lilygrove returns to her normal form after the polymorph potion wears off, spitting out Zarak’s hand. She then shapeshifts to a mini size and falls asleep, being carried by Gahr during the journey back to Little Oak. Upon waking, she attempts to touch a squirrel but falls down Gahr’s back and returns to her normal size just as a goat-turned-redcap attacks her. Lilygrove tries to cast fear magic by bopping a redcap on its nose, and although the redcaps throw a tantrum and leave, Lily ends up breaking her hand during the skirmish. When the party reaches Little Oak, Lilygrove threatens Sloane telepathically and participates in the planning session to infiltrate Loomlurch. She later shapeshifts into Will to act as bait during the mission. In the marketplace at Loomlurch, she swaps a trinket for sweets that cause her to froth at the mouth and lose the ability to speak. After the party meets Skabatha Nightshade, Lilygrove reveals her true form and attempts to attack the hag, but Skabatha petrifies her in response. The party places Lilygrove inside Gahr’s Bag of Holding for safekeeping.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XII - The Massacre of Loomlurch Lilygrove is freed from the Bag of Holding by Gahr after the battle, once the hags remove the curse that had affected her. Upon regaining consciousness, she immediately attacks the owlbear, Juniper, forcing it to flee into a patch of poisonous snakes. Despite the chaos and loss around her, Lilygrove regains her composure and, along with Gahr and the new arakocra party member, flees Loomlurch with four rescued children, seeking refuge at Little Oak.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XIII - The Return to Loomlurch Lilygrove casts hexes and uses spells like Booming Blade during battles against mimics and tin soldiers. She cloaks the area in darkness to protect the party and later dispels it to allow her allies to attack. Lilygrove shows her frustration and anger throughout the session, particularly in her interactions with Sloane and Pippa. She also attempts to cast a spell on Pippa that backfires. Lilygrove secures Sowpig in the bag of holding after revealing her ghoul-like visage.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XIV - The Ironscale Hydra Lilygrove reveals deep personal truths, including her struggle with alcoholism and her tragic past involving the deaths of her family. Throughout the session, she grapples with her emotions and the challenges posed by the group's journey. Lilygrove engages in battle with Cradlefall, attempting to use her magical abilities to gain the upper hand. She later participates in the battle against the harpies and the hydra, using her magic to contribute to the fight. However, she falls unconscious during the hydra battle.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XV - The Mushroom Hunt Lilygrove takes on a central role in interacting with Pincushion, ultimately ripping off the doll's head and leading the group through tense situations. She engages in combat with tin soldiers, helps in calming down Brottor, and takes on the role of a 1950s housewife, feeding everyone while maintaining her disguise. Lilygrove also searches for a cure for Brottor, deals with the consequences of her actions, and helps in destroying rooms by setting fires. Her interaction with Pincushion and her ability to guess the correct magic word show her resourcefulness and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XVI - The Bridge Wedding Lilygrove is forced to confront her past during a conversation with Feathereen, only to have Gahr Reigh emphasize the importance of her new \"family,\" inadvertently friend-zoning her. Lily is then put on trial by Mr. Witch and Mr. Light, where she is transformed into a pig as punishment for her defiance. Her transformation and subsequent interactions with Bahr and Gahr lead to confusion and tension within the group.\r\n\r\nDuring events of Session XVII - The Accidental Visit Lilygrove examined a checkers board at Lockberry Henge and discovered sooty footprints leading to two stones. She solved the board, revealing two Korreds. Lilygrove discovered six more Korreds in the area and later walked away from Noel the Obsidian, a Korred, who then tried to grab her. In response, Lilygrove used magic against Noel, which led to her being forced to dance by another Korred. When encountering a cyclops, Lilygrove immediately cast Eldritch Blast at it, provoking a fight where she was knocked unconscious. After recovering, she later downed the cyclops with hex and her sword. During a picnic in the Palace of Hearts Desire, Lilygrove questioned the attendees about the hags but received no useful information. When the three hags arrived, Lilygrove shapeshifted into her Bullywug form and confronted them, leading to a battle where she was ultimately knocked unconscious.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XVIII - The Theatre Production Lilygrove read a warning in Elvish on the letter from the Hourglass Coven, demanded Amidor take the group to Motherhorn, agreed to an open marriage with Bahr Reigh, refused a healing cupcake from a farmer, flew towards Endelyn Moongrave in anger, and later returned to the group after realizing she couldn't defeat the hag. She played a nervous apothecary in the play, broke mirrors in a dressing room, and releasing poisonous gas.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XIX - The Wooden Masks Lilygrove interacts with books in strange ways, like licking them and shapeshifting. She accidentally gets cursed but is healed by Klej. She also frequently causes disruptions and eventually gets turned into a wooden mask by a darkling.",
