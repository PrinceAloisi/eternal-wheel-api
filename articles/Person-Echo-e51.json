    "content": "Forged 2,921 cycles ago, Echo (Designation: Tamo) is a fabricator Faerlwrought designed to assist in the production of arms and armour during the conflict between the wild elves, The Blight and the other dark races during The Bloodsworn Wars. From their creation, Echo worked tirelessly forging weapons in the furnaces of Raelfor, working armour in the tanneries of Segilana and crafting enchanted items of jewellery for nobles and generals amongst the elven races. Due to their minimal requirements for rest and inhuman precision with their crafting, Echo was a master crafter imbued with millennia of knowledge in craftsmanship and craftworks of both the Faerl and the Salin elves, or at least those not closely guarded as secrets amongst the master crafters of the respective cities. During the year 880 DR, an alien ship crash landed near the city of Raelfor where Echo was based at the time. The master crafters that Echo worked under, explained that this was the second ship that had crashed within the realm of the moon elves. The first was a smaller ship that crashed near Raelfor in 50 DR and would eventually be reverse engineered to provide the moon elves with technology that would be the catalyst of the empire transforming into a technologically advanced civilisation. It was this technology that would eventually give birth to the Faerlwrought.\r\n\r\nWhile this second ship was largely destroyed upon impact, Echo and the master crafters sought to create their own prototype airship in order to take to the stars and escape the Blight ravaging their lands as a last resort. Retrieving the still functioning Spelljammer Helm from the wreckage, they were able to create a proto-type airship designated the “The Shrike”. The construction of this prototype became Echo’s primary designation as a last hope for the elves in the event of Blight victory. Due to their designation as a fabricator, Echo saw minimal conflict outside the cities of their work, but nevertheless was programmed with the knowledge for basic combat training, and their chassis was designed with the ability to bond to different tools and armaments, capable of absorbing them into their makeup and making them part of their very being. While initially crafted with just the tools necessary for their trade, Tamo’s body is capable of being augmented with multiple weapons and pieces of armour that can be stored within the largely hollow interior of their limbs, provided they are of the appropriate size, and shape to be housed.\r\n\r\nIn one of the final conflicts in the city of Raelfor during a major offensive by The Blight, the Halls of Fabrication were sacked by a host of Orcs, and Tamo was severely damaged in the ensuing destruction. Thankfully, Echo was able to seal the hangar to The Shrike prototype – while the design was still incomplete and not yet able to fully traverse the Realm of Astralum, its functionality as a state-of-the-art airship could not fall into enemy hands, lest it become a devastating weapon in the war. As the city fell in the onslaught around their prostrate form, Tamo’s functions gradually ceased until conscious processing stopped altogether, witnessing the destruction occurring around them but unable to do anything to prevent it. Lying dormant for over 2,500 cycles due to a misaligned gear in their central processing limb, or what passes for a “head” in the organic races, Tamo was recently reactivated when a family of field mice that had been making a home in their “head” bumped the gear back into place, reactivating the Faerlwrought and sending the serendipitous saviours scurrying through the ruins. With several of their memory circuits degraded beyond repair, Tamo lost much of the secret knowledge of their creators, with only partial memories of their basic functions remaining intact.\r\n\r\nRepairing the damage to their body over the following decades through the slow process of melting, absorbing and fabricating their missing and damaged parts, Tamo finally emerged to find a new and unfamiliar world they did not recognise or understand, much of the once-great beauty of the Faerl and Salin now lost to time, and the other races seeming less civilised and more opportunistic than ever before. Tamo now seeks to collect the lost knowledge of their creators in order to preserve their ancient secrets, perfect themselves through the lost arts of metallurgy and creation magic, and through this knowledge return order and light to what now feels a dreary and uncultured world by seeking to restoring the lost Elvish empires and bringing the world to a new golden age. Unsealing the long-hidden warehouse in which The Shrike was concealed, Echo embarked and began their journey to complete their long-unfinished work.",
