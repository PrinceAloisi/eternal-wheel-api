    "content": "During the events of Session II - The Crowning of the Monarch Tarin joined the group as a Goliath Barbarian with a struggle in writing due to a lost ability. She was terrified by the illusions in the Mystery Mine, particularly the giant rats that haunted her. Tarin floated in a bubble towards the Dragonfly Ride but found nothing significant. She adopted the pixie name Toadhop in the Pixie Kingdom and was caught during the hide and seek game. In the Whack-a-Mole game, Tarin successfully defeated the mimic and killed Tin Soldiers. During the gondola ride, she was the first to be tipped overboard by Feathereen. Tarin took on a riddle challenge at the Calliope and was briefly transported to a vision where she encountered Sylphrena, the Dreamweaver, gaining knowledge. She later assisted in cornering Kettlesteam, the Kenku heckler, and entered the Hall of Illusions, where she used the doll given by Kettlesteam to restore Candlefoot's voice. Tarin was declared the winner of the Calliope challenge and earned a free pass to explore more of the carnival. She stepped through the mirror to Hither with the rest of the group.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session III - The Slanty Tower Tarin is hit by multiple daggers but continues to fight, eventually decapitating one of the Lornlings. Tarin takes a leading role during the Giant Constrictor Snake encounter, entering a rage and dealing significant damage to one of the snakes. She is constricted by the snake but manages to break free and kill the snake by cutting off its head. Tarin tries to open the door in the tower but is grabbed by Lorna, the Lornling, and she screams when Nishara tries to talk to her telepathically. After Lorna escapes, Tarin and the rest of the party attempt to track her but are unsuccessful. Tarin helps set up camp for the night and stands guard to protect the group.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session IV - The Missing Firbolg Tarin gives up her glass slipper to Agdon Longscarf as payment for safe passage. Tarin helps rescue Gahr Reegh from the bog and assists in fighting the Merrows, eventually landing a successful blow. She later helps put out the fires in the balloon factory and reads a secret note found in a wine goblet, which leads the party to a new task involving the Sinking Palace. Tarin continues to support the party by helping in the battle against the Merrows and stabilizing Gahr Reegh after he falls unconscious.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session V - The Loss of a Friend Tarin is put to the test during the proving ground battle, where she must fight Morgot to the death. Despite the tension, Tarin successfully defeats Morgot but later encounters more challenges as she tries to free Wirth and deals with the aftermath of the illusion. At Trinket and Bauble’s shop, Tarin acquires a gem containing faerie fire, paying with her eye color. Tarin also plays a key role in the battle with the tree, but she falls unconscious during the fight. After being stabilized by Talia, Tarin helps the group return to the palace to recover and later assists in organizing Nishara’s burial.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VI - The Medusa's Gaze Tarin takes on challenges head-on, such as providing the letter to gain entry to the Bullywug Hut and participating in the battle with the Medusa. Like Talia, Tarin is partially petrified during the fight but is later restored by Bavlorna Blightstraw, although her elbow remains stiff. Tarin's bravery and determination are evident as she continues to contribute to the group's efforts, even as she deals with the physical and emotional toll of their recent battles.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VII - The Electric Shock Tarin is the first to act when the party is asked to present a letter at the Bullywug Hut, providing the letter from King Gullop XIX to gain entry. During the encounter with the Dark Mantle, Tarin is caught off guard as the creature attaches itself to her head, but she fights valiantly to remove it. In the battle with the gelatinous cube, Tarin’s weapon becomes a crucial tool in the fight, though she suffers significant injuries. Despite these setbacks, Tarin confronts Lilygrove about her betrayal and helps to interrogate her, ultimately agreeing to the uneasy alliance with her.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VIII - The Hag of Downfall Tarin accompanies Lilygrove as they examine the corridor’s artwork and later attempting to help move the stubborn mirror with Gahr. When the group shrinks after entering the hidden passageway, Tarin is instrumental in helping them navigate the challenges that arise, including freeing Gahr from being trapped under a cabinet. Tarin’s investigative nature leads her to examine a mysterious frog statue with Kiara, though the results remain inconclusive. She also plays a crucial role in uncovering Bavlorna’s secrets, helping to defeat the Dark Mantle that attaches itself to her head and later assisting in the kitchen where they encounter Bloody Toes. Tarin helps release the birds in the aviary and assists in retrieving valuable items from Bavlorna’s hoard.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session IX - The Blood Pact Tarin experiences significant developments, starting with the restoration of her ability to write legibly after interacting with the bronze frog statue. Her investigative nature leads her to explore various aspects of Bavlorna's cottage, including the frog statue and the mirror. Tarin's persuasive skills are evident as she convinces Gahr to shed his trousers during a humorous debate. She also plays a protective role when she grabs Kiara in Nib’s Cave during the tense exchange about her twin. Tarin's loyalty to the group is clear as she participates in the blood pact, vowing to stand united against the Hourglass Coven.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session X - The Unicorn of Wayward Pool Tarin shows her emotional depth when she sees Myrtle's ghost on the Ethereal Plane during the campestris' dance, leading her to cry. She later explores Little Oak, discovering Squirt, the guide of Thither, and joins the party in their journey to Wayward Pool. Tarin is thrown by the lake's magic when she removes her unicorn costume, and she uses a stick as a horn to rejoin the group. In the battle against Zarak, Tarin rage-swims closer to the assassin and casts Faerie Fire, though it only illuminates Kiara. Her determination in combat is evident as she continues to pursue and attack Zarak, contributing to the party's victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XI - The Knight and the Paladin Tarin questions the presence of goats by an oak tree and later engages in combat with the redcaps after they revert from their polymorphed goat forms. She helps plan the infiltration of Loomlurch with the Getaway Gang and later partakes in the mission, where she eats sweets in the marketplace that cause her head to swell immensely. During the confrontation with Skabatha, Tarin retrieves oil from the defeated boggles to give to Squirt. She also plays a role in reassuring the children trapped in Loomlurch after defeating a contingent of tin soldiers. Tarin takes the oil back to Squirt and plans to travel to the Witchlight Carnival to return Star to its parent.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XIV - The Ironscale Hydra Tarin engages in combat with Cradlefall, the harpies, and the hydra, using her strength and combat skills to protect her companions. Tarin's determination and bravery are on full display as she takes on the hydra, ultimately contributing to the group's victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XV - The Mushroom Hunt Tarin takes on a protective role, particularly towards Lilygrove, and engages in combat with tin soldiers, helping to eliminate threats. She also plays a key part in the group's interactions with Brottor, helping to calm him down and providing healing support when needed. Tarin's leadership and combat skills are on full display as she leads the group in navigating dangerous situations and ensuring the safety of the children they encounter. Her interactions with Will and her questioning of his non-human nature show her determination to protect the group and seek answers.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XVI - The Bridge Wedding Tarin faces multiple challenges during the session, starting with an awkward encounter with Feathereen at Silverswan Lake. Tarin's reluctance to ride the swan causes tension, but she remains focused on the group's mission. She takes on a protective role during Lilygrove's trial, attempting to shift blame onto Meela. During the battles, Tarin's rage powers her through the shadows, dealing significant damage and helping to protect her companions.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XVII - The Accidental Visit Tarin impressed Argantle of Shale by learning the Korred special jig. During a battle with a cyclops, Tarin entered a fury after seeing Lilygrove Thornwhisper knocked unconscious and fought fiercely. After being transported by a tornado, Tarin picked up Meela Puddlemuck during a picnic when tensions rose. In the battle against the three hags of Prismeer, Tarin fought alongside the group but was ultimately knocked unconscious like the rest of the heroes.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XVIII - The Theatre Production Tarin asked Bahr Reigh to repair her axe, which was eventually mended by Klej, called out to Lilygrove to come down from flying towards the hag, played a high and mighty princess in the play, investigated the cells and interacted with several trapped persons, received three potions of healing from Elegy, and tried to convince Hurly, the Bugbear, to take her upstairs. She also cried after hearing about Myrtle Shellback.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XIX - The Wooden Masks Tarin gives books to Lilygrove to read out alou and to save Lilygrove from being turned into a mask. She has a brief, awkward interaction with Mordren Pekkan, and later discovers important information from a talking marionette.",
