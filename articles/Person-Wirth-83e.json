    "content": "During the events of Session I - The Witchlight Carnival! Wirth is a towering Firbolg cleric who struggles to remember names and must knock before entering a room or opening any door. He reluctantly handed over his ticket to a child and later received a new ticket with the pact that he cannot talk about his favorite subject. Wirth caught a sycamore seed, which turned into a gold piece. He failed to catch a faerie dragon and was unsuccessful in the goblin wrestling event, where he tripped and was pinned by a goblin. Wirth also failed to outstare the cyclops. During a rat attack, he killed one rat with his mace and healed Talia Starfinder after she was injured. Wirth chose the black snail Queen's Majesty for the snail race but did not win. He participated in the gnome poetry contest and the ring toss game but did not win.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session II - The Crowning of the Monarch Wirth eagerly entered the Mystery Mine first, where he faced his worst fears. After the ride, he floated in a bubble towards the Staff Area but found nothing noteworthy. Wirth adopted the pixie name Cotton Candy in the Pixie Kingdom and was caught during the hide and seek game. He participated in the Whack-a-Mole game but failed in his first attempt to attack the mimic. Wirth noticed the connection between the hecklers and Kettlesteam during the disturbance at Silversong Lake. He helped corner Kettlesteam and questioned her, learning about her connection to Zybilna. Wirth restored Nishara's ability to move by picking her up while she was laughing uncontrollably in the Hall of Illusions. He also carried Nishara as they searched for Rubin Sugarwood and observed the strange events within the Hall of Illusions. Wirth consumed the most cupcakes during the Feasting Orchard’s eating contest, earning a Cupcake of Invisibility. He joined the group in stepping through the mirror to Hither, following the advice of Mister Witch and Mister Light.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session III - The Slanty Tower Wirth struggles during the initial battle with the Lornlings, missing his first attack but eventually landing a hit with his mace. He is hit by a dagger and falls unconscious during the fight but is revived by Nishara's healing. Wirth provides healing to Tarin Ganu-Maga after the battle and continues to support the party during the Giant Constrictor Snake encounter. He successfully strikes the snake with his mace and helps the party during the confrontation with Lorna, the Lornling. Wirth fails to stabilize Nishara during her near-death experience but continues to assist the group in their efforts to defeat the snakes. After Lorna's escape, Wirth helps search for supplies and contributes to the group's survival by finding water. He stands by to heal the party members as needed during their rest at the tower.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session IV - The Missing Firbolg Wirth falls into the bog and is later found in a holding cell in the Soggy Court. Wirth provides valuable healing support during the party’s encounters and continues to be a reliable member of the group. Despite falling into the bog and being captured, Wirth is eventually reunited with the party and resumes his role as a healer and supporter.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session V - The Loss of a Friend Wirth vanishes in an illusion, replaced by a blue bird. The party's attempts to interact with the illusion reveal that Wirth is no longer physically present, though his disappearance prompts further investigation. Wirth’s whereabouts remain uncertain as the party continues their journey, ultimately leading to their solemn burial of Nishara.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VI - The Medusa's Gaze Wirth is found safely with the Bullywug rebellion after the group discovers that his earlier disappearance was an illusion. He reassures the party of his well-being and stays with them as they navigate through the challenges in The Soggy Court. Wirth plays a crucial role in healing and supporting the party, especially after Myrtle is swallowed by a giant toad. He later defeats the Medusa in a fierce battle but is forced to retreat after slipping on the stairs inside Bavlorna Blightstraw's cottage.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VII - The Electric Shock Wirth calls upon a Sacred Flame to help defeat the wasps and later inflicts wounds upon the gelatinous cube during the chaotic battle. Wirth is also instrumental in reviving the party’s spirits after the difficult encounters, reminding them of their shared goals and the importance of staying united. As the group confronts Lilygrove about her betrayal, Wirth remains calm and measured, helping to defuse the situation.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session VIII - The Hag of Downfall Wirth suffers from Lilygrove’s accidental injury while attempting to open the small door. Despite this setback, Wirth remains focused on aiding the group as they explore Bavlorna’s cottage. He is privy to Lilygrove’s secret reflection in the mirror, which adds an intriguing layer to their relationship. Wirth’s divine powers and healing abilities are crucial during their encounters with the various threats within the cottage, including the gelatinous cube and the Dark Mantle.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session IX - The Blood Pact Wirth receives the Pipes of Haunting from Octavian as a token of gratitude. In the chaotic events within Nib’s Cave, Wirth maintains his skepticism of Kiara and challenges her to prove her innocence when her twin is mentioned. He plays a role in binding both Kiara and the changeling version of Miara (Lilygrove in disguise) when the situation escalates, showing his cautious approach to potential threats.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session X - The Unicorn of Wayward Pool Wirth, during the encounter with Lamorna, Wirth humorously responds to Talia's feeling of being watched with a simple \"Neigh.\" In the battle against Zarak, Wirth successfully hits the assassin with a sacred flame, contributing to the party's eventual victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XI - The Knight and the Paladin Wirth continues to support the party, engaging in the battles they face. In the marketplace at Loomlurch, Wirth is transformed into a butterfly after eating sweets he received in exchange for a trinket. Talia catches him in a jar, and Kiara shakes it, reversing the spell and returning Wirth to his normal form. Wirth plays a key role in the battle against the tin soldiers and helps reassure the children that the party is there to help them.\r\n\r\nDuring the events of Session XII - The Massacre of Loomlurch Wirth claims a set of tongs and tools during the distribution of items. Throughout the battle, he fights alongside his companions, using his abilities to aid the group. However, Wirth ultimately meets his end during the final confrontation. After his death, his body is absorbed by his companion Chee, who transforms into a lizard and accompanies the arakocra that arrives shortly after the group's demise.",
